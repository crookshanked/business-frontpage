    As a seasoned professional with a passion for technology and cybersecurity, I've been immersed in the digital realm since the early days of the internet. My journey began with a BFA in Web Design and Interactive Media, where I honed my skills in design, programming, and user experience.

<p>
    Over the years, I've expanded my expertise to encompass a wide range of technical disciplines, including system administration, cybersecurity, and DevOps. My CompTIA Security+ CE certification validates my commitment to safeguarding digital assets and mitigating cyber threats. I've also gained valuable experience in Agile methodologies, having served as a SAFe Agile Scrum Master, leading and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

    My ability to bridge the gap between creative design and technical implementation has enabled me to deliver innovative solutions. I am a dedicated problem-solver, always eager to learn and adapt to emerging technologies. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am passionate about contributing to the security and resilience of digital systems.
